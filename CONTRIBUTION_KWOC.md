# Contributing Guidelines
- Create a Pull Request to the `kwoc` branch, with a message briefly explaining the changes you made
- Also mention the issue number you are solving, in case there is no issue, feel free to create one and addres it in your PR.
- It would be nice if you can also put a screenshot of the UI changes you made in the PR message
- See that when you design, it is responsive, fits to the mobile screen as well.
